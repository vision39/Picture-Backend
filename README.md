# Picture Backend

This is the **backend** for the Picture app. It provides API endpoints, authentication, and database logic for the application.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.
3. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure

- `index.js` — Main entry point
- `model/` — Database models and logic
- `.env.example` — Example environment variables

## Notes

- This repository contains only the backend logic. The frontend is managed in a separate repository.
- For deployment, use your preferred Node.js hosting provider.
